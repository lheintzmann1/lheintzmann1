# Hi there, I'm Lucas üëã

## About Me

I'm a high school student from France and a passionate programmer who loves working on challenging projects that push my skills to the limit. My main interests are game development, physics simulations, and software engineering in general. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me playing video games, watching movies, or exploring the great outdoors.

## Technologies

- <code><img src="/img/c.png"/></code> C
- <code><img src="/img/cpp.png"/></code> C++

- <code><img src="/img/git.png"/></code> Git

## Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on recently:

- ü¶ï **Dino Game Clone:** A clone of the popular Chrome Dino Game built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/lheintzmann1/DinoGame) for more details.

- üßÆ **NumWorks Physics Engine:** A simple physics engine built using Python for the NumWorks calculator. This was a fun project that challenged me to think outside the box. You can find the [repository](https://github.com/lheintzmann1/Numworks-Physics-Engine) here.

- üåç I'm also the founder of [**LuHe Open Labs**](https://github.com/LuHe-Open-Labs), a non-profit organization dedicated to creating innovative, open-source projects. Our goal is to use technology to make a positive impact on the world and help people solve real-world problems. Our first and ambitious project is :

- üöÄ **ANOMALY:** Is a research project that aim to create realistic simulations of ecosystems. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/LuHe-Open-Labs/Anomaly2D) for more information.

### **üöß New Project Opportunity: Join Us! üöß**

I'm currently assembling a team for an ambitious new game development project. If you're experienced in Unreal Engine 5, C++, or have a passion for game design, physics simulations, or modding, I would love to hear from you! This project aims to create a highly realistic simulation game with advanced mechanics and modding capabilities.

Interested in joining the team or learning more? Please reach out to me through the contact options below!
